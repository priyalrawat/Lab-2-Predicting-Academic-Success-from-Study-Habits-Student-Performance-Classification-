# Lab-2-Predicting-Academic-Success-from-Study-Habits-Student-Performance-Classification-

**Abstract**
This research has evaluated the effectiveness of machine learning models for predicting 
student academic success using behavioral, demographic, and academic performance features. 
Given a dataset of 10,000 students from Kaggle, five different classification models such as 
Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes were 
built and evaluated. The current findings were expected, as the new models were developed 
using a variety of features, including exam scores, assignment completion rate, study hours, 
sleeping habits, and discussion participation. The dataset was pre-processed, and a binary 
outcome of success was created as the target variable. The individual model and collective 
evaluation results exhibited outstanding classification performance. All models were perfect with 
the evaluation metrics, specifically Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression 
models. Feature importance analysis indicated that exam scores and assignment completion rate 
were the most significant predictors, and the impact of discussion participation was of 
significance. The overall findings are consistent with predictive analytics applications in 
education context while raising more questions related to dataset limitations and the need for 
more complicated and diverse educational data in future research.
